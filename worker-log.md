# Worker log

One entry per task: what was done, numbers (wires, shards, bytes, load time, warnings), what is open.

## T1 (2026-11-13): pinned sopworld and validation

- `tools/sopworld/sopworld.mjs` = `docs/sopworld.mjs` of soplang-words-lib at c7247e2 (0.14.0, build ab7bc4ec2db6,
  426,896 bytes, sha256 d7240105...); `tools/sopworld/VERSION` names commit, build and sha256 (a test checks them).
- `package.json` (type module, no dependencies); `npm test` = `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`.
- `tools/validate.mjs` (helpers in `tools/lib/worlds.mjs`): for every `docs/worlds/k.*/schema.sop`, a World with all
  schemas as its library and `use(<world>)`; then each shard told into a fork of it (wires, bytes, load ms, warnings
  printed), and all shards of the world together (catches duplicate ids across shards). Errors: refused changes, parse
  errors, a shard without the `# sources:` / `# license:` / `# script:` header lines, a fact without `core.source`,
  a matrix wire in a shard, more than 2,000 wires or 300 kB.
- Numbers: 0 worlds yet; npm test 5/5 pass (fixture worlds check that each error kind is caught).

## T2 (2026-11-13): catalog and vocabulary builders

- `tools/build-catalog.mjs` validates everything (stops on any error), then writes `docs/worlds/index.json` (PLAN.md §2
  format; per world also `version` from the schema's `# version:` header line and `warnings`; per shard `license`,
  `nc: true` for NC licenses, `warnings`) and `docs/worlds/vocab.json`. `--check` exits 1 when the files are stale.
- Catalog `version`: a sha256 (12 hex) of every file under `docs/worlds` except the two generated ones, not the git sha
  (a commit cannot contain its own sha; see Q1).
- Vocabulary: lowercased `text=` of shard `core.word` wires -> that shard; identity-key values of shard wires -> that
  shard; schema `core.word` for a value (`of=`) -> the shards holding that value, for a type or key -> every shard of
  the world. Shard `keys` = its identity-key values, lowercased, sorted.
- Sorted output, 1-space JSON indent; a test rebuilds in memory and compares byte for byte with the files on disk.
- Numbers: 0 worlds, 0 shards, 0 words; npm test 10/10 pass.

## T3 (2026-11-13): Pages

- `docs/index.html`: one plain page: what this is, the files and the catalog fields, the list of worlds read from
  `index.json` at run time (shards, wires, licenses), and a minimal JS example in place of the numbered steps: fetch the
  catalog and vocab, fetch a schema (and those in `depends`) into the `library`, `use` it, tell the shards that
  `vocab['fish']` points to, `query`, and a soft issue. `tests/page.test.mjs` runs the example itself against
  `docs/worlds` with `fetch` served from disk (skipped until `k.commonsense` exists).
- `docs/worlds/README.md` explains the files, `index.json` fields and `vocab.json`. `.nojekyll` kept.
- Numbers: 0 worlds; catalog version changes with README (it hashes the folder); npm test 11 pass, 1 skipped.

## T4 (2026-11-13): k.commonsense core

- `docs/worlds/k.commonsense/schema.sop` (module `k.commonsense`, exports `thing`, `placed`; version 1 as a header line,
  Q3): `k.commonsense.thing` (shared, closed; `name` identity, `at`/`can`/`used_for`/`made_of` many, `size` enum
  tiny..huge, `usually_count` integer); `k.commonsense.placed` (`thing`, `at`, `scene`) for what an application puts in
  a scene; 4 soft denies: water thing in the sky, water thing on grass (each with `?thing` and `?place` in `why`), a
  thing that cannot fly and is not usually in the sky placed in the sky (`not=` twice), more than `usually_count` in one
  scene (`core.calc fn=count over=`, with `core.select=first` on the anchor so there is one issue per scene and thing,
  not one per placement); 5 schema words. Matrix ids fully qualified (Q4).
- `shards/core.sop`: 15 things + 15 `core.word` (forms such as fishes, airplane), every wire `core.source="hand-core 1"`.
- `sources/hand-core/SOURCE.md`; license CC0-1.0 provisional (Q2). `WORLD.md`.
- `tests/k.commonsense.questions.jsonl`: 20 lines (10 queries, 10 statements with their soft issues), run by
  `tests/questions.test.mjs` on a fork each; every statement must be accepted. The page example now runs too.
- Numbers: schema 37 wires, 5,095 bytes, load 18 ms; shard 30 wires, 3,963 bytes, load 10 ms; 0 warnings, 0 issues;
  vocab 45 words; npm test 33 pass.
- Found: an answer resting on a knowledge wire with a standing issue is `conflicting` (S50), so a scene with a fish in the
  sky makes "where does a fish live" conflicting (noted in WORLD.md). Order-dependent merge: a fact of a subtype told
  after a fact of its parent type with the same identity is not merged (two wires), told before it is (one wire); so
  `k.objects.object` does not extend `k.commonsense.thing` (joined by name instead).

## T5 (2026-11-13): k.objects core, with the T5 amendment (drawable parts)

- `docs/worlds/k.objects/schema.sop` (module `k.objects`, imports `k.commonsense`, exports object, part, point;
  version 1): `k.objects.object`; `k.objects.part` (identity `of` + `name`; `kind` for repeated parts; required `shape`
  from the closed enum rectangle/square/circle/oval/triangle/line/arc/polygon, required box `x y w h` 0..100, required
  integer `z`, required many `colour`; `pointing`/`opens` for triangles and arcs (Q5); `above below inside left_of
  right_of on` many, `centered` boolean); `k.objects.point` (`of` ref to the part, `n`, `x`, `y`). No `count`: one wire
  per instance (amendment). 4 schema words.
- 7 shards by category, 30 objects (the 19 asked + apple, butterfly, cup, chair, table, umbrella, ladder, lighthouse,
  moon, star, plane: all Quick, Draw! categories), 168 parts, 139 points, 30 object words + 20 part-kind words.
  Hand-chosen coordinates; boxes of lines and polygons computed from their points by a throwaway formatter (not
  committed; the .sop files are the source).
- `tools/render-svg.mjs` (about 110 lines): facts -> plain SVG (viewBox 0 0 100 100), shapes drawn in their boxes by z;
  writes 30 SVGs + `index.html` to `docs/worlds/k.objects/preview/` (30,128 bytes). Looked at by eye (contact sheet);
  the cup was white on white, now red first.
- Tests: `tests/k.objects.questions.jsonl` (14: parts of a house; roof above body; crown green; 2 windows by kind; wheels;
  common sense through the import; a soft issue), `tests/k.objects.render.test.mjs` (every object renders; boxes inside
  the frame; known shapes; circle/square w = h; points only and always for lines/polygons, numbered 1..n, box = their
  bounds; every relative position names a part of the same object and agrees with the boxes; `centered` is centred;
  previews on disk are up to date).
- Numbers: schema 32 wires, 4,502 bytes, 4 ms; shards (wires / bytes / load ms): animals 64 / 9,558 / 6, buildings
  39 / 5,842 / 4, figures 51 / 7,497 / 5, household 43 / 6,095 / 3, nature 33 / 4,726 / 2, sky 52 / 6,493 / 7,
  vehicles 110 / 14,774 / 7; total 392 wires, 54,985 bytes; 0 warnings, 0 errors. Catalog: 2 worlds, 8 shards, 238
  vocab words. npm test 80 pass.
- Questions Q5-Q8.

## T6 (2026-11-13): Round 1 report

**Numbers.** 2 worlds, 2 schemas (69 matrix wires), 8 shards, 422 fact wires, 58,948 bytes of shards; 0 errors, 0
warnings, 0 standing issues. Load: `k.commonsense` complete (schema + shard) 22 ms, `k.objects` complete (both schemas,
all 8 shards) 49 ms, single shards 2-10 ms. Catalog: 238 vocab words. npm test: 80 pass (validation, catalog,
page example, 34 world questions, render test for 30 objects).

**What worked.**
- Modules exactly as PLAN.md §2 says: a schema in the `library`, `use` or `imports=`, exports limiting reads; types
  `shared=true` so an application's facts in its own namespace join knowledge facts by value.
- Soft rules as `core.deny … soft=true` with variables in `why`; a count rule with `core.calc fn=count over=` and
  `core.select=first` on the anchor gives one issue per scene and thing. Nothing is refused.
- `query` answers the test questions directly (`value`, `values` for many keys, `list`, `count`, `check`).
- Drawable parts: a renderer with no knowledge of the objects draws all 30 from the facts (see `preview/`).
- The page's JS example is run by the tests, so it cannot drift from the sopworld API.

**What the schema could not say, or only with a workaround.**
- A world's schema version: `core.module` does not read `version=` (warning) → `# version:` header line (Q3).
- Short matrix ids clash with the application's ids under `imports=` (ids unchanged) → fully qualified ids (Q4).
- A subtype across modules (`k.objects.object extends k.commonsense.thing`) merges order-dependently → no `extends`,
  joined by name (Q8).
- "A water thing placed in the sky or on grass": no "one of" in a pattern → two soft denies with a `core.check fn=eq`
  each (no new syntax needed, but the rule is written twice).
- Orientation of triangles and arcs is not given by a box → `pointing` / `opens` keys (Q5). Repeated parts → unique
  names plus `kind` (Q6). Points name their part by reference (Q7).
- An answer that rests on a knowledge wire with a standing issue is `conflicting` (S50): once a fish is in the sky,
  "where does a fish live" is conflicting. Applications should ask knowledge questions on a fork without the scene,
  or read `alternatives`.
- The catalog version is a content hash, not a git sha (Q1). The hand-core license is provisionally CC0-1.0 (Q2).

**Not done in Round 1 (not asked in T1-T6):** `docs/worlds/LICENSES.md` (PLAN.md §5) and a CI workflow (M0); both are
small and can come with Round 2. `CHANGELOG.md` will start with the first breaking schema change.

**Questions for the reviewer:** Q1-Q8 in `questions.md`.

## R2.1 (2026-11-13): Q7 rename, rule 4, LICENSES.md, CI

- Q7: `k.objects.point` refers to its part with `part=$<part id>` (was `of=`); identity `part` + `n`. 139 point wires in
  7 shards, the renderer, WORLD.md. `k.objects` schema version 2; `CHANGELOG.md` started (breaking change).
- AGENTS.md rule 4: matrix ids fully qualified.
- `tools/build-catalog.mjs` also writes `docs/worlds/LICENSES.md`: per source of a published shard, the `What`,
  `Origin`, `License` and `Attribution` lines of `sources/<id>/SOURCE.md`, the shard terms and the worlds using it.
  It is a generated file (not part of the content hash); the catalog test compares it byte for byte.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: `npm test` and `build-catalog --check` on push and pull request (node 22).
- Numbers: unchanged facts (2 worlds, 8 shards, 422 fact wires, 58,948 shard bytes, 0 warnings); npm test 81 pass.

## R2.2 (2026-11-13): k.words from WordNet 3.1

- Sources: WordNet 3.1 from `nltk/nltk_data` on GitHub (`wordnet31.zip`, commit 550b662, sha256 in SOURCE.md; it has
  the `.exc` lists that npm `wordnet-db` lacks, the data files are the same); frequency list: FrequencyWords English
  2018 (`hermitdave/FrequencyWords` 525f9b5, `en_50k.txt`, CC BY-SA 4.0), its first 20,000 lines, used as a filter
  only (Q9). The Google-derived lists were not used (unclear terms).
- `docs/worlds/k.words/schema.sop` (version 1, exports `sense`): `k.words.sense` (shared, closed; identity `word` +
  `pos` + `n`; `gloss` string; `synonym`, `is_a`, `instance_of`, `part_of` many, atom or string). 10 matrix wires, no
  rules, no schema words (Q10).
- `tools/import/wordnet.mjs` (+ `tools/import/lib.mjs`: value, id, wire, header, split helpers): the 3 most frequent
  senses per word and part of speech; gloss without examples; first word of each hypernym / instance hypernym / part
  holonym synset; irregular forms and lower-case text for capitalised words as `core.word` facts; senses WordNet
  marks as slurs, offensive or vulgar left out (61). Shards by the first two letters, sorted by word; a bucket over
  1,800 wires / 270 kB would split into `xx-1`, `xx-2` (none does).
- Tests: `tests/import.wordnet.test.mjs` (a made-up fixture in WordNet's format; same input same bytes; splitting;
  and, when the raw files are there, the shards on disk are byte for byte what the importer gives; skipped in CI where
  raw is absent), `tests/k.words.questions.jsonl` (11).
- Numbers: 19,697 usable list words → 10,471 words with a noun or verb sense, 26,116 senses, 2,835 `core.word`
  wires (1,264 irregular forms); **28,951 wires, 318 shards, 5,610,059 bytes**; largest shard `co` 1,185 wires,
  229,974 bytes, load 21 to 35 ms; median shard under 2 ms; all 318 shards one after another 0.8 s of load (0.8 s for the
  whole world in one instance); schema 8 ms; 0 warnings, 0 errors. Catalog: 3 worlds, 326 shards, vocab 11,726 words
  (index.json 262 kB, vocab.json 484 kB). npm test 97 pass in about 10 s.
- Limits found: values are words, not senses (a reference to a sense in another shard would dangle), so chains
  (`dog` → `canine` → …) are followed by looking the value up as a word again; values of several words are strings
  (Q11); a capitalised word is its own value (`word=China` sense 1, `word=china` sense 2), found from lower case
  through a `core.word` fact.

## R2.6 pilot (2026-11-13): 200 drawable objects from Noto Emoji

(Done right after R2.1 as the reviewer asked at 08:35; R2.2 was already pushed when that message arrived.)
- Sources: `googlefonts/noto-emoji` 99701e0, folder `2D/svg` (Apache-2.0, `2D/svg/LICENSE`); names, keywords and
  groups from Unicode CLDR 48 (`cldr-json` 48.2.3 annotations, `emoji-test.txt` of `unicode-org/cldr` release-48;
  Unicode-3.0). Notices published as `k.objects/LICENSE.noto-emoji` and `LICENSE.cldr`. Shard licence
  `Apache-2.0 AND Unicode-3.0`. Twemoji was not compared: the first 20 Noto conversions were all recognisable next
  to the originals, and Apache-2.0 is the more permissive of the two.
- `tools/import/svg-parts.mjs` (SVG reader without dependencies: path flattening incl. curves and arcs, transforms,
  style and attribute fills, gradients to one flat colour, Douglas-Peucker, colour names by nearest CIE Lab distance)
  and `tools/import/noto-emoji.mjs`. Things kept: 861 emoji in the groups Animals & Nature, Food & Drink, Travel &
  Places, Activities, Objects; 32 dropped as not things (clock faces per half hour, card suits); 829 remain, of which
  18 have a hand-written object of the same name and are left out (Q12). **The 1,200 to 1,800 expected are not
  there**: without faces, people, hands, flags and symbols the emoji set has about 830 things.
- Schema additions (not breaking): `variant` (object, part), `rgb`, `named`, colour enum of 11 names, names may be
  strings. Renderer: exact colours drawn flat, names of several words, `--label` mode (parts outlined and numbered).
  Catalog: `part1…partN` are placeholders, not vocabulary words.
- Pilot = every 4th thing in list order (`sources/noto-emoji/limit.txt` = 200): **200 objects, 2,429 parts, 29,499
  points, 200 word wires; 32,328 wires, 53 shards, 3,937,882 bytes** = 162 wires and 19.7 kB an object on average
  (12.1 parts, 147 points). One shard (avg 610 wires, 74 kB) loads in about 20 ms; all 53 in 1.0 s; 0 warnings.
- **Looked at all 200 at 160 px (4 contact sheets): 197 recognisable (98.5%)**. Weak: abacus (beads lost to the
  16-part cap), computer disk and ring (holes dropped). Fixed after the first look: translucent highlights (opacity
  under 0.75) were drawn solid and hid the candy and the diya lamp; they are dropped now.
- Tests: `tests/import.noto.test.mjs` (made-up SVG and list; primitives, holes, overlays, gradients, names from the
  TSV, determinism; disk shards = importer output when raw files are present), render test for every object.
  npm test 300 pass, 24 s.

## R2.7 pilot (2026-11-13): names for the parts of the 200 pilot objects

- `tools/render-svg.mjs --label <dir> [object …]`: the object at 320 px, every part outlined and numbered in draw
  order (the number sits on a spot later parts do not cover, when there is one), names underneath once they exist.
- Looked at all 200 objects on 34 contact sheets of 6 and wrote `sources/noto-emoji/part-names.tsv`
  (`object, part number, name, kind`; 833 rows). The import script reads it; the build stays deterministic.
- **611 of 2,429 parts got a name (25%), 222 more are marked `kind=detail`** (highlights, veins, stripes, text
  lines) and keep `partN`; 181 of 200 objects have at least one row. Named parts carry `named=model`; repeated parts
  have `left_`/`right_`/`front_`/`back_` or a number and a `kind` (`eye`, `ear`, `wheel`, `window`, `whisker`).
- What kept parts unnamed (only-when-sure rule): drawings made of many overlapping layers of one thing (a part and
  its shade or outline at the same place: which is "the body"?), facets (diamond, pretzel, bacon, tamale), and
  numbers that sit on top of each other. Animals, faces, vehicles and buildings name well; food and tools less.
- 12 labelled examples in `docs/worlds/k.objects/preview/label-*.svg` (dog face, frog, baby chick, mouse face, taxi,
  hut, saxophone, teddy bear, hot dog, hammer, office building, full moon face), shown on the preview page.
- Tests: `tests/k.objects.names.test.mjs` (every TSV row is a part that exists with that name, kind and
  `named=model`; names unique inside an object; "parts of a dog face" answers head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, tongue,
  patch; "which objects have a wheel" now also finds taxi, minibus, skateboard). Vocabulary: part names are words
  (`wheel` → the shards with wheels); 12,210 words. npm test 302 pass.

## R2.6 full run (2026-11-13): all things of Noto Emoji

- The pilot passed the 85% bar (197 of 200), so `sources/noto-emoji/limit.txt` is 0 (all).
- **811 objects** (861 listed − 32 not things − 18 with a hand-written object of the same name), 10,188 parts
  (12.6 an object), 121,764 points (150 an object), 802 word wires; **133,565 wires, 124 shards, 16,236,240 bytes**:
  165 wires and 20.0 kB an object, 6.5 objects a shard; largest shard 1,696 wires / 205,273 bytes (inside the gate).
  A shard loads in 32 ms on average; all 124 in 4.0 s; 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `k.objects` now has 841 objects (30 hand-written + 811). Previews: 841 SVGs + 12 labelled, 3.6 MB.
- Catalog: 3 worlds, 450 shards, vocab 12,994 words (index.json 327 kB, vocab.json 716 kB).
- npm test: 913 pass in 60 s (one render test per object; validation loads every shard twice).
- The 611 objects outside the pilot are looked at one by one during R2.7 (labelling pictures); what is found
  unrecognisable there is reported with those batches.

## R2.7 batch 1 (2026-11-13): 108 more objects looked at (308 of 811)

- Animals (birds, bugs, mammals, marine, reptiles) and the first arts and book objects, on 9 sheets of 12.
- part-names.tsv now has rows for 278 objects: **1,002 parts named, 268 marked detail** (this batch: +391 names,
  +46 details, 97 of 108 objects got at least one row). Faces name almost completely (cat face 12 of 16, cow face
  11 of 11); whole animals mostly body, head, tail, legs, eyes.
- Seen while labelling, not recognisable after conversion: spider web (the holes of the web are dropped: a dark
  blob), gorilla, panda (dark shapes cover the face), lizard (head and legs lost to the 16-part cap). 4 of 108.
- npm test 913 pass; 133,565 wires, 124 shards (unchanged); vocab 13,022 words.

## R2.7 batch 2 (2026-11-13): 108 more objects looked at (416 of 811)

- Books and paper, clothes, shoes, hats, computer things, dishware, drinks, events, Asian food, first fruits.
- part-names.tsv: rows for 361 objects; **1,205 parts named, 387 marked detail** (this batch: +203 names, +119
  details, 83 of 108 objects with a row). Clothes, food and drinks name less than animals: often only the main part
  (cup, bottle, shirt) and a few details are sure.
- Not recognisable: optical disk, dvd (plain discs; the hole and the shine are lost). 2 of 108.
- npm test 913 pass; shards unchanged in number and wires; vocab 13,088 words.

## R2.7 batch 3 (2026-11-13): 108 more objects looked at (524 of 811)

- Fruit, bread, meat, prepared food, sweets, vegetables, games, household, cameras and lights, locks.
- part-names.tsv: rows for 451 objects; **1,416 parts named, 541 marked detail** (this batch: +211 names, +154
  details, 90 of 108 objects with a row). (The commit message of this batch, 98d38ce, gives 458 / 1,444 / 558 /
  +239 / 97: those were written before the build finished and are wrong; these are the measured numbers.)
- Not recognisable: piñata, mirror ball, nesting dolls. 3 of 108.
- npm test 913 pass; shards unchanged in number and wires.

## R2.7 batch 4 (2026-11-13): converter fix for frames and rings; 113 objects looked at (601 of 811)

- **Converter fix found while labelling** (the three charts were grey boxes): a path that is mostly hole (a frame, a
  ring, a disc with a hole) was filled solid once its hole was dropped, and hid everything drawn before it. Such a
  shape (holes at least half of its area) is now a closed `line` along its outer edge; holes are found whatever
  the order of the subpaths. 129 objects changed; charts, ring, discs, panda, mirror ball, package, abacus are
  recognisable now. Noto shards after the fix: 811 objects, 10,152 parts, 120,941 points, **132,706 wires, 124
  shards, 16,153,844 bytes**.
- 70 of the changed objects were renumbered (part numbers moved); the 36 of them that had names lost their rows
  and were looked at again in this batch, so no name points at a wrong part (the names test checks row by row).
- Looked at: the 70 renumbered ones again, then mail, medical, money, music, office, phones, first buildings.
  part-names.tsv: rows for 509 objects; **1,537 parts named, 641 marked detail**.
- Not recognisable so far (of 601 looked at): spider web, gorilla, lizard, piñata, nesting dolls, brick. 6.
- npm test 913 pass; vocab 13,186 words.

## R2.7 batch 5 (2026-11-13): 108 more objects looked at (709 of 811)

- Buildings, places, scenes, flowers, plants, science, moons, weather, sound, balls.
- part-names.tsv: rows for 592 objects; **1,767 parts named, 708 marked detail** (measured). Scenes (cityscape, national park, desert) get only a sun or
  a sky; weather and flowers name well (sun, cloud, rays, stem, petals).
- Not recognisable: foggy, fog (plain grey areas). 8 so far of 709.

## R2.7 batch 6 (2026-11-13): the last 102 objects looked at (811 of 811)

- Sport, clocks, tools, weapons, air, rail and road vehicles, ships, pens.
- **R2.7 done for every imported object.** part-names.tsv: rows for 680 of 811 objects; **2,027 of 10,152 parts
  named (20%), 748 more marked `kind=detail`**; 131 objects have no sure name at all (layered food, facets, scenes).
  Vehicles name best (wheels, windows, lights, mirrors with `kind`), then animals and faces.
- **Recognisable after conversion: 801 of 811 (98.8%)**, judged on the 320 px labelling pictures. Not recognisable:
  spider web, gorilla, lizard, piñata, nesting dolls, brick, foggy, fog, link, parachute.
- npm test 913 pass; 132,706 wires, 124 shards; vocab 13,269 words.

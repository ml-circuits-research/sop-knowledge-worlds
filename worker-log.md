# Worker log

One entry per task: what was done, numbers (wires, shards, bytes, load time, warnings), what is open.

## T1 (2026-11-13): pinned sopworld and validation

- `tools/sopworld/sopworld.mjs` = `docs/sopworld.mjs` of soplang-words-lib at c7247e2 (0.14.0, build ab7bc4ec2db6,
  426,896 bytes, sha256 d7240105...); `tools/sopworld/VERSION` names commit, build and sha256 (a test checks them).
- `package.json` (type module, no dependencies); `npm test` = `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`.
- `tools/validate.mjs` (helpers in `tools/lib/worlds.mjs`): for every `docs/worlds/k.*/schema.sop`, a World with all
  schemas as its library and `use(<world>)`; then each shard told into a fork of it (wires, bytes, load ms, warnings
  printed), and all shards of the world together (catches duplicate ids across shards). Errors: refused changes, parse
  errors, a shard without the `# sources:` / `# license:` / `# script:` header lines, a fact without `core.source`,
  a matrix wire in a shard, more than 2,000 wires or 300 kB.
- Numbers: 0 worlds yet; npm test 5/5 pass (fixture worlds check that each error kind is caught).

## T2 (2026-11-13): catalog and vocabulary builders

- `tools/build-catalog.mjs` validates everything (stops on any error), then writes `docs/worlds/index.json` (PLAN.md §2
  format; per world also `version` from the schema's `# version:` header line and `warnings`; per shard `license`,
  `nc: true` for NC licenses, `warnings`) and `docs/worlds/vocab.json`. `--check` exits 1 when the files are stale.
- Catalog `version`: a sha256 (12 hex) of every file under `docs/worlds` except the two generated ones, not the git sha
  (a commit cannot contain its own sha; see Q1).
- Vocabulary: lowercased `text=` of shard `core.word` wires -> that shard; identity-key values of shard wires -> that
  shard; schema `core.word` for a value (`of=`) -> the shards holding that value, for a type or key -> every shard of
  the world. Shard `keys` = its identity-key values, lowercased, sorted.
- Sorted output, 1-space JSON indent; a test rebuilds in memory and compares byte for byte with the files on disk.
- Numbers: 0 worlds, 0 shards, 0 words; npm test 10/10 pass.

## T3 (2026-11-13): Pages

- `docs/index.html`: one plain page: what this is, the files and the catalog fields, the list of worlds read from
  `index.json` at run time (shards, wires, licenses), and a minimal JS example in place of the numbered steps: fetch the
  catalog and vocab, fetch a schema (and those in `depends`) into the `library`, `use` it, tell the shards that
  `vocab['fish']` points to, `query`, and a soft issue. `tests/page.test.mjs` runs the example itself against
  `docs/worlds` with `fetch` served from disk (skipped until `k.commonsense` exists).
- `docs/worlds/README.md` explains the files, `index.json` fields and `vocab.json`. `.nojekyll` kept.
- Numbers: 0 worlds; catalog version changes with README (it hashes the folder); npm test 11 pass, 1 skipped.

## T4 (2026-11-13): k.commonsense core

- `docs/worlds/k.commonsense/schema.sop` (module `k.commonsense`, exports `thing`, `placed`; version 1 as a header line,
  Q3): `k.commonsense.thing` (shared, closed; `name` identity, `at`/`can`/`used_for`/`made_of` many, `size` enum
  tiny..huge, `usually_count` integer); `k.commonsense.placed` (`thing`, `at`, `scene`) for what an application puts in
  a scene; 4 soft denies: water thing in the sky, water thing on grass (each with `?thing` and `?place` in `why`), a
  thing that cannot fly and is not usually in the sky placed in the sky (`not=` twice), more than `usually_count` in one
  scene (`core.calc fn=count over=`, with `core.select=first` on the anchor so there is one issue per scene and thing,
  not one per placement); 5 schema words. Matrix ids fully qualified (Q4).
- `shards/core.sop`: 15 things + 15 `core.word` (forms such as fishes, airplane), every wire `core.source="hand-core 1"`.
- `sources/hand-core/SOURCE.md`; license CC0-1.0 provisional (Q2). `WORLD.md`.
- `tests/k.commonsense.questions.jsonl`: 20 lines (10 queries, 10 statements with their soft issues), run by
  `tests/questions.test.mjs` on a fork each; every statement must be accepted. The page example now runs too.
- Numbers: schema 37 wires, 5,095 bytes, load 18 ms; shard 30 wires, 3,963 bytes, load 10 ms; 0 warnings, 0 issues;
  vocab 45 words; npm test 33 pass.
- Found: an answer resting on a knowledge wire with a standing issue is `conflicting` (S50), so a scene with a fish in the
  sky makes "where does a fish live" conflicting (noted in WORLD.md). Order-dependent merge: a fact of a subtype told
  after a fact of its parent type with the same identity is not merged (two wires), told before it is (one wire); so
  `k.objects.object` does not extend `k.commonsense.thing` (joined by name instead).

## T5 (2026-11-13): k.objects core, with the T5 amendment (drawable parts)

- `docs/worlds/k.objects/schema.sop` (module `k.objects`, imports `k.commonsense`, exports object, part, point;
  version 1): `k.objects.object`; `k.objects.part` (identity `of` + `name`; `kind` for repeated parts; required `shape`
  from the closed enum rectangle/square/circle/oval/triangle/line/arc/polygon, required box `x y w h` 0..100, required
  integer `z`, required many `colour`; `pointing`/`opens` for triangles and arcs (Q5); `above below inside left_of
  right_of on` many, `centered` boolean); `k.objects.point` (`of` ref to the part, `n`, `x`, `y`). No `count`: one wire
  per instance (amendment). 4 schema words.
- 7 shards by category, 30 objects (the 19 asked + apple, butterfly, cup, chair, table, umbrella, ladder, lighthouse,
  moon, star, plane: all Quick, Draw! categories), 168 parts, 139 points, 30 object words + 20 part-kind words.
  Hand-chosen coordinates; boxes of lines and polygons computed from their points by a throwaway formatter (not
  committed; the .sop files are the source).
- `tools/render-svg.mjs` (about 110 lines): facts -> plain SVG (viewBox 0 0 100 100), shapes drawn in their boxes by z;
  writes 30 SVGs + `index.html` to `docs/worlds/k.objects/preview/` (30,128 bytes). Looked at by eye (contact sheet);
  the cup was white on white, now red first.
- Tests: `tests/k.objects.questions.jsonl` (14: parts of a house; roof above body; crown green; 2 windows by kind; wheels;
  common sense through the import; a soft issue), `tests/k.objects.render.test.mjs` (every object renders; boxes inside
  the frame; known shapes; circle/square w = h; points only and always for lines/polygons, numbered 1..n, box = their
  bounds; every relative position names a part of the same object and agrees with the boxes; `centered` is centred;
  previews on disk are up to date).
- Numbers: schema 32 wires, 4,502 bytes, 4 ms; shards (wires / bytes / load ms): animals 64 / 9,558 / 6, buildings
  39 / 5,842 / 4, figures 51 / 7,497 / 5, household 43 / 6,095 / 3, nature 33 / 4,726 / 2, sky 52 / 6,493 / 7,
  vehicles 110 / 14,774 / 7; total 392 wires, 54,985 bytes; 0 warnings, 0 errors. Catalog: 2 worlds, 8 shards, 238
  vocab words. npm test 80 pass.
- Questions Q5-Q8.

## T6 (2026-11-13): Round 1 report

**Numbers.** 2 worlds, 2 schemas (69 matrix wires), 8 shards, 422 fact wires, 58,948 bytes of shards; 0 errors, 0
warnings, 0 standing issues. Load: `k.commonsense` complete (schema + shard) 22 ms, `k.objects` complete (both schemas,
all 8 shards) 49 ms, single shards 2-10 ms. Catalog: 238 vocab words. npm test: 80 pass (validation, catalog,
page example, 34 world questions, render test for 30 objects).

**What worked.**
- Modules exactly as PLAN.md §2 says: a schema in the `library`, `use` or `imports=`, exports limiting reads; types
  `shared=true` so an application's facts in its own namespace join knowledge facts by value.
- Soft rules as `core.deny … soft=true` with variables in `why`; a count rule with `core.calc fn=count over=` and
  `core.select=first` on the anchor gives one issue per scene and thing. Nothing is refused.
- `query` answers the test questions directly (`value`, `values` for many keys, `list`, `count`, `check`).
- Drawable parts: a renderer with no knowledge of the objects draws all 30 from the facts (see `preview/`).
- The page's JS example is run by the tests, so it cannot drift from the sopworld API.

**What the schema could not say, or only with a workaround.**
- A world's schema version: `core.module` does not read `version=` (warning) → `# version:` header line (Q3).
- Short matrix ids clash with the application's ids under `imports=` (ids unchanged) → fully qualified ids (Q4).
- A subtype across modules (`k.objects.object extends k.commonsense.thing`) merges order-dependently → no `extends`,
  joined by name (Q8).
- "A water thing placed in the sky or on grass": no "one of" in a pattern → two soft denies with a `core.check fn=eq`
  each (no new syntax needed, but the rule is written twice).
- Orientation of triangles and arcs is not given by a box → `pointing` / `opens` keys (Q5). Repeated parts → unique
  names plus `kind` (Q6). Points name their part by reference (Q7).
- An answer that rests on a knowledge wire with a standing issue is `conflicting` (S50): once a fish is in the sky,
  "where does a fish live" is conflicting. Applications should ask knowledge questions on a fork without the scene,
  or read `alternatives`.
- The catalog version is a content hash, not a git sha (Q1). The hand-core license is provisionally CC0-1.0 (Q2).

**Not done in Round 1 (not asked in T1-T6):** `docs/worlds/LICENSES.md` (PLAN.md §5) and a CI workflow (M0); both are
small and can come with Round 2. `CHANGELOG.md` will start with the first breaking schema change.

**Questions for the reviewer:** Q1-Q8 in `questions.md`.

## R2.1 (2026-11-13): Q7 rename, rule 4, LICENSES.md, CI

- Q7: `k.objects.point` refers to its part with `part=$<part id>` (was `of=`); identity `part` + `n`. 139 point wires in
  7 shards, the renderer, WORLD.md. `k.objects` schema version 2; `CHANGELOG.md` started (breaking change).
- AGENTS.md rule 4: matrix ids fully qualified.
- `tools/build-catalog.mjs` also writes `docs/worlds/LICENSES.md`: per source of a published shard, the `What`,
  `Origin`, `License` and `Attribution` lines of `sources/<id>/SOURCE.md`, the shard terms and the worlds using it.
  It is a generated file (not part of the content hash); the catalog test compares it byte for byte.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: `npm test` and `build-catalog --check` on push and pull request (node 22).
- Numbers: unchanged facts (2 worlds, 8 shards, 422 fact wires, 58,948 shard bytes, 0 warnings); npm test 81 pass.

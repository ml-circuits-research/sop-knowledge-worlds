# Worker tasks

Written by the reviewer. The worker (a coding agent) follows [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md), works one task
per commit, logs numbers in `worker-log.md`, and asks in `questions.md` (the reviewer answers here, never in
`questions.md`). Language and syntax questions: stop and ask. The reviewer decides under the owner's rule: simplest
option, never one sign or construct with two meanings.

## Round 1 (M0 + M1): infrastructure and two hand-written cores

**T1. Pinned sopworld and validation.**
- Copy `docs/sopworld.mjs` from `ml-circuits-research/soplang-words-lib` at commit `c7247e2` (0.14.0) into
  `tools/sopworld/sopworld.mjs`, and write `tools/sopworld/VERSION` with the commit and the build id.
- Add a `package.json` (type module, no runtime dependencies) and `npm test` (node:test).
- Write `tools/validate.mjs`: it loads every `docs/worlds/*/schema.sop` as a library module, plus each of the world's
  shards, into a fresh World, and fails on any error. It prints warnings, wires, bytes and load time per shard.

**T2. Catalog and vocabulary builders.**
- `tools/build-catalog.mjs` writes `docs/worlds/index.json` (format in PLAN.md §2) and `docs/worlds/vocab.json` (lemma → shard
  ids, from the `core.word` facts of the schema and from the identity-key values of the shard wires, lowercased).
- Deterministic output: the files are sorted and reruns give no diff.
- A test checks that every shard listed exists and loads, and that every vocab entry points to a listed shard.

**T3. Pages.**
- `docs/index.html` is one plain page: what this is, the contract of PLAN.md §2 with a minimal JS example (fetch the
  catalog, fetch a schema and one shard, load them into a sopworld World, run one `query`), and the list of worlds read
  from `index.json` at run time.
- `docs/worlds/README.md` explains the catalog.
- Add a `.nojekyll` file. The owner enables Pages on `main` /docs.

**T4. `k.commonsense` core (hand-written, about 40 facts, plus tests).**
- **Schema** (module `k.commonsense`, `core.module … exports=`): `k.commonsense.thing`, typical location (`at`),
  capability (`can`), use (`used_for`), material (`made_of`), size class, how many usually (`usually_count`, e.g.
  sun = 1 in a scene).
- **Soft rules** (`core.deny … soft=true why="… ?thing … ?place …"`): a thing whose typical location is water, placed
  in the sky or on grass; more than the usual count of a one-of-a-kind thing; a thing that cannot fly, placed in the sky.
- **Instances:** fish, bird, sun, moon, cloud, tree, house, car, boat, plane, flower, grass, star, dog, cat. One shard.
- `tests/k.commonsense.questions.jsonl` covers `query` answers and soft issues; nothing is refused.

**T5. `k.objects` core (hand-written, 30 objects, plus tests).**
- **Schema** (module `k.objects`, imports `k.commonsense`): `k.objects.object`, `k.objects.part` (`of`, `name`), the
  relative position of a part (`above`, `below`, `inside`, `left_of`, `right_of`, `on`, `centered`), a rough box
  (`x y w h` in a 0–100 frame of the object), typical colour (repeated values allowed), and count (`windows=2`).
- **Instances:** house (body, roof above, door bottom centre, two windows, chimney on roof), tree, car, boat, sun, flower,
  person (stick figure), cat, dog, fish, bird, cloud, mountain, rocket, robot, castle, bicycle, train, snowman, plus
  10 more of your choice from the Quick, Draw! categories.
- **Tests:** "what are the parts of a house", "where is the roof of a house" → `above body`, and "what colour is a
  tree's crown" → `green`.

**T6. Log and report.** Write `worker-log.md` with numbers per task. Close the round with a short report in
`worker-log.md`: what worked, what the schema could not say, and questions for the reviewer.

## Round 2 (M2 + M3): bulk import, to be detailed after Round 1

- ConceptNet 5.7 English edges with weight ≥ 2 for PartOf, HasA, AtLocation, UsedFor, CapableOf, MadeOf, IsA → `k.commonsense`
  and `k.objects`. Shard by first letter, or by category for objects. CC BY-SA 4.0, published with attribution.
- Quick, Draw! simplified strokes: per category, a layout skeleton (bounding boxes of stroke clusters, mapped to the parts
  of T5 where possible) → `k.objects`. CC BY 4.0. Report which categories give a usable skeleton.
